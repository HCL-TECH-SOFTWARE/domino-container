# Learning Resources

The Domino container project provides a lot of useful information to get the container image built and run containerized Domino servers.
It is still very important to understand the basic concepts of the underlaying container technology.
The referenced material is a good starting point to look at the underlaying technology.

Because containers are a fast moving technology, please make sure to look into up to date information and avoid older documentation and older blog posts.


# Recommended Docker YouTube Videos

There are a lot of learning resources around Docker and Containers available on YouTube.
A good starting point are the videos from [Techworld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWorldwithNana).

If you never worked with containers, there is a one hour video [Docker in 1 Hour](https://youtu.be/pg19Z8LL06w) for a quick jump start.  
This video should be a good starting point. But there are longer videos about Docker, Kubernetes(K8s) and related topics available.

This one hour video is really recommended if you never worked with Docker.


# Docker documentation and learning resources

The official [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) is also a very good starting point.
Beside the [manuals](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/) and the [Docker command-line reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/) there are [Get started tutorials](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and more.


# Domino One Touch Setup (OTS) GitHub project

Domino One Touch Setup(OTS) plays an important role setting up Domino in a container.
There is a separate HCL Open Source project  [Domino One Touch Setup (OTS)](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/domino-one-touch-setup) providing additional documentation, howto information and full examples.


# OpenNTF Webinars

OpenNTF Webinars are monthly 90 minute online webinars about current Domino topics.
They are are a great resource presented by HCL Ambassadors and other experts from the community.
