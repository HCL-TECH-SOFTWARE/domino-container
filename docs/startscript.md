## Introduction
The Domino cross platform start/stop and diagnostic script has been written to unify and simplify running Domino on Linux and UNIX. The start script is designed to be "one-stop shopping" for all kind of operations done on the Linux/UNIX prompt. The script can start and stop the server, provides an interactive console and run NSD in different flavors. It ensures that the environment is always setup correct and supports multiple partitions.

This script is designed to run with a dedicated user for each partition.
Out of the box the script is configured to use the "notes" user and the standard directories for binaries (/opt/ibm/domino) and the data directory (/local/notesdata).

You should setup all settings in the script configuration file.

## Usage
