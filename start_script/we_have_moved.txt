We've moved
-----------

The Nash!Com Domino Start script has moved sources to a separate GitHub project.
Those sources have been in the project for convenience and have never been actively used.

The container project uses a tar file containing the start script as part of the deployment.
With the current build script the start script is now pluggable and can be downloaded separately like any other install software.
It is part of the software.txt directory and can be switched once new versions are released.

You find the new git repository, the new documentation and the download here:
