# Contributing to this Domino Docker project
We welcome contributions but request that you follow these guidelines.

### Reporting a bug

Please raise any bug reports on the project's issue tracker. Be sure to search the list to see if your issue has already been raised.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. Also, provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.
## New features
Please raise any new feature requests on the project's issue tracker.

## Pull requests

### Changes to existing code
If you want to raise a pull request with a new feature, a bug fix, or a refactoring of existing code, make sure to open an issue in the project's issue tracker first before engaging in serious development work. This will start a discussion and help in accepting the pull request.

### Coding standards
Please ensure you follow the coding standards used throughout the existing code base. Some basic rules include:

* All files must have the Apache license in the header.
* Indent with 4 spaces, no tabs. No arguments.
* Opening brace on same line as if/for/function/etc, closing brace on its own line.

### Contributor License Agreement
In order for us to accept pull requests, you must declare that you wrote the code or, at least, have the right to contribute it to the repo under the open source licence of the project in the repo. It's dead easy...

1. Read this (from <a href ="https://developercertificate.org/">developercertificate.org</a>):

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
  have the right to submit it under the open source license
  indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
  of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
  license and I have the right under that license to submit that
  work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
  by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
  permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
  in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
  person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
  it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution

2. If you can certify that it is true, sign off your git commit with a message like this:
3. 
```
Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@email.com>
```
You must use your real name (no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions, sorry).

Instead of typing that in every git commit message, your Git tools might let you automatically add the details for you. If you configure them to do that, when you issue the ```git commit``` command, just add the ```-s``` option.

If you are an IBMer, please contact us directly as the contribution process is slightly different.
